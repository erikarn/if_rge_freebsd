TODO list
=========

 * [done] I deleted the kstat code from the driver, but it turns out
   the way to get stats from the NIC is actually a stats counter
   page via DMA.

   See rge_kstat_read() in the openbsd driver and bring back the
   code that does the DMA transaction to fetch the stats page
   from the hardware, then .. populate a sysctl list for now?

 * I've seen some cases where leaving the NIC unplugged for a while
   and then plugging it in results in a watchdog timeout; need to see
   if that's playing bad with dhclient (which backs off pretty quickly)
   and figure out if the timeout is due to my code.

 * Add TX/RX producer/consumer/ring space entries in sysctl so I can see
   if the rings are getting stuck in obviously terrible ways.

 * Make the number of packets serviced per txeof and rxeof a sysctl
   tunable.
