TODO list
=========


 * I deleted the kstat code from the driver, but it turns out
   the way to get stats from the NIC is actually a stats counter
   page via DMA.

   See rge_kstat_read() in the openbsd driver and bring back the
   code that does the DMA transaction to fetch the stats page
   from the hardware, then .. populate a sysctl list for now?
